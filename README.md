# Readme

If you have questions about this week's lab, reading, or lecture, ANY TA for this class can help you with any problems.

## Getting Started Again™

2. Go to Modules
5. Click `Skills Lab Week 4` and click where is says `Click Here!`
6. JupyterHub should open up to this week's materials!

### If JupyterHub doesn't work for you

Use Binder!

_**Important**:_ Binder does **not** always save your work. If you need to stop working on your lab for more than 30 minutes, you need to **download** your exercises notebook to you computer. Then, you can reupload it again later to continue your work.
